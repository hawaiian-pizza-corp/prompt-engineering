	## Popular Questions and Answers

	**Q: Why would anyone put pineapple on pizza?**
	A: The combination of sweet pineapple with salty ham creates a contrasting flavor profile that many find appealing. 
	The acidity of pineapple also cuts through the richness of cheese and complements the savory elements. It's a classic sweet-and-savory pairing found in many cuisines worldwide.

	**Q: Is Hawaiian pizza really from Hawaii?**
	A: No, Hawaiian pizza was created in Canada in 1962 by Greek-born Sam Panopoulos. 
	The name comes from the brand of canned pineapple used, not its origin.

	**Q: What cheese is best for Hawaiian pizza?**
	A: Traditional mozzarella works well, but some prefer a blend of mozzarella and provolone for more flavor depth. 
	Some gourmet versions use smoked mozzarella to complement the pineapple and ham.

	**Q: Should pineapple be fresh or canned on pizza?**
	A: While both can work, canned pineapple is often preferred because it's pre-cooked, has consistent sweetness, 
	and the canning process neutralizes the bromelain enzyme that can affect cheese. Fresh pineapple should be pre-cooked or at least well-drained.

	**Q: What drink pairs best with Hawaiian pizza?**
	A: Light, crisp beers like lagers or wheat beers work well. For wine, try an off-dry Riesling or rosÃ©. 
	Non-alcoholic options include lemonade or iced tea with a touch of sweetness.
